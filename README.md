# day-of-week-trainer
Hacked together in an hour or so after watching a video on how to determine the day of the week from the date. This is of extremely limited value and the code is written to a "hurry up and finish this" level of quality. Don't know why you'd want to look at -- or even *gasp* **use** -- this code, but this seemed as good a place to back this up as anywhere else.
